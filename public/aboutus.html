  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Welcome to our platform‚Äîa budget-friendly review and study companion designed especially for students. We understand how challenging education can be, not only academically but also financially. Many existing study tools and review platforms lock their best features behind expensive monthly subscriptions, making them inaccessible for countless students who need them most. That is why we created this platform: to provide high-quality, interactive, and engaging study resources at an affordable, one-time cost.</p>
  <p>Our mission is simple: to make learning more effective, collaborative, and enjoyable for everyone‚Äîwithout breaking the bank. By offering lifetime access for a one-time low price, we eliminate the stress of recurring fees and give students peace of mind knowing they will always have access to all current and future features. Whether you‚Äôre preparing for exams, working on daily study sessions, or collaborating with classmates, this platform was built with you in mind.</p>

  <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
  <p>Education is constantly evolving. Students today are expected to juggle assignments, projects, online classes, and extracurricular activities‚Äîall while staying motivated and on track. But let‚Äôs be honest: studying alone can sometimes feel boring, repetitive, and overwhelming. On top of that, traditional study tools are often either too expensive or too limited.</p>
  <p>We wanted to change that. By combining affordability with rich, interactive features, our platform bridges the gap between learning and fun. We strongly believe that knowledge retention increases when studying is enjoyable and engaging. That‚Äôs why we didn‚Äôt just stop at creating flashcards‚Äîwe built a complete ecosystem of tools that promote focus, productivity, and collaboration.</p>
